This is the decompiled code from the MSDOS version of the game "MEURTRES EN SERIE" (from Cobra Soft).
It was originaly compiled with Aztec C compiler version 3.4b.
If you want to build the two executable files (SERCQ.EXE and DIGIT.EXE) you will need to download the correct compiler version.
Then edit the two batch files DOIT.BAT and DOIT2.BAT so that CROOT points to your installation of the compiler.

I also included a patch from fellow retro-programmer karamoon. I can be activated by setting the macro PATCH_KARAMOON.


There is no much left to say so ... enjoy !
